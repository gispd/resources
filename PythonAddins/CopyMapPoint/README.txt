This is the CopyMapPoint project created by the ArcGIS Desktop Python AddIn Wizard. The CopyMapPoint_addin.py file includes the source code for this
AddIn.

This sample AddIn is an ArcMap tool that copies the map x, y coordinates as degrees, minutes, seconds to the clipboard.
The coordinates can be copied into maps.google.com. 

For more information about creating AddIns with Python, see the ArcGIS Guide book for building AddIns with Python:
